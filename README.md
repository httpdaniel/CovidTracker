## Info

CovidTracker is a web application used to visualise live data from the COVID-19 pandemic. This data includes the number of cases for each country as well as the number of recoveries and deaths. Data graphs as well as a world map are used so that you can see exactly what is happening in all countries around the world and analyse the trend in cases.

## Technology

The CovidTracker is built entirely in JavaScript using the React.js framework.
Firebase is used as the back-end to handle data.
Material UI is used to style the application along with Sass.

## API

The API used for this project was sourced from https://disease.sh/ and is used to accumulate the COVID-19 data.
