CovidTracker is a web application used to visualise live data from the COVID-19 pandemic. This data includes the number of cases for each country as well as the number of recoveries and deaths. Data graphs as well as a world map are used so that you can see exactly what is happening in all countries around the world and analyse the trend in cases.

## Framework

The CovidTracker is built entirely in JavaScript using the React.js framework.

## API

The API used for this project was sourced from https://disease.sh/ and is used to accumulate the COVID-19 data.
